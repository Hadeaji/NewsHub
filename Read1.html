<h1> The Evening Standard newspaper has announced plans to make job cuts in both editorial and commercial departments </h1>
<h3> as part of a major restructure that will shift the company’s </h3>
<h3> focus to its digital and mobile platforms. </h3>

<h3> But the printed edition of the newspaper will be retained under the strategy, which was set out to staff this morning by the company’s new chief executive, </h3>
<h3> Charles Yardley, as he informed them that 115 jobs are likely to be lost – including 69 out of 167 editorial positions. </h3>

<h3> Mr Yardley told The Independent that the move was part of a long-term plan rather than solely a response to the coronavirus downturn, </h3>
<h3> which has hit many publishers’ revenues hard. </h3>
