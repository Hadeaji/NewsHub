## he Evening Standard newspaper has announced plans to make job cuts in both editorial and commercial departments
as part of a major restructure that will shift the company’s
focus to its digital and mobile platforms.

But the printed edition of the newspaper will be retained under the strategy, which was set out to staff this morning by the company’s new chief executive, Charles Yardley, as he informed them that 115 jobs are likely to be lost – including 69 out of 167 editorial positions.

Mr Yardley told The Independent that the move was part of a long-term plan rather than solely a response to the coronavirus downturn, which has hit many publishers’ revenues hard.
